#Check for Palindrome: Create a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
#A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. For instance, “madam” and “racecar” are palindromes.

#taking a input from the user
palindrome = str(input("Word Please:"))
list = []
#appending each item from the input to a empty list
for i in palindrome:
    list.append(i)
#checking if the reverse of the list is equal to the original list, if yes it's a palindrome
if list == list[::-1]:
    print("This is a Palindrome")
else:
   print("This is NOT a Palindrome")
